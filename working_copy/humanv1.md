# REFERENCE TAXONOMY INCIDENT  Taxonomy (human readable version)


This is the Reference Security Incident Classification Taxonomy.

See the [machine readable version](machinev1) as well. It should have an identical contents to the human readable version.
Note that the 1st column is mandatory, the 2nd colum is an optional but desired field.

Version: 1
Generated from [machine readable version](machinev1). Please do not edit this file directly in github, rather use the machinev1 file.


| CLASSIFICATION (1ST COLUMN)                                   | INCIDENT EXAMPLES (2ND COLUMN)        | Description / Examples |
|---------------------------------------------------------      |------------------------------------   |------------------------|
| Abusive Content | Spam | Or 'Unsolicited Bulk Email', this means that the recipient has not granted verifiable permission for the message to be sent and that the message is sent as part of a larger collection of messages, all having a functionally comparable content. |
| Abusive Content | Harmful Speech | Discreditation or discrimination of somebody, e.g. cyber stalking, racism or threats against one or more individuals. |
| Abusive Content | Child Porn/Sexual/Violent Content | Child pornography, glorification of violence, etc. |
| Malicious Code | Virus | Software that is intentionally included or inserted in a system for a harmful purpose. A user interaction is normally necessary to activate the code. |
| Malicious Code | Worm | see 'virus' |
| Malicious Code | Trojan | see 'virus' |
| Malicious Code | Spyware | see 'virus' |
| Malicious Code | Dialer | see 'virus' |
| Malicious Code | Rootkit | see 'virus' |
| Information Gathering | Scanning | Attacks that send requests to a system to discover weaknesses. This also includes testing processes to gather information on hosts, services and accounts. Examples: fingerd, DNS querying, ICMP, SMTP (EXPN, RCPT, ...), port scanning. |
| Information Gathering | Sniffing | Observing and recording of network traffic (wiretapping). |
| Information Gathering | Social Engineering | Gathering information from a human being in a non-technical way (e.g. lies, tricks, bribes, or threats). |
| Intrusion Attempts | Exploitation of known Vulnerabilities | An attempt to compromise a system or to disrupt any service by exploiting vulnerabilities with a standardised identifier such as CVE name (e.g. buffer overflow, backdoor, cross site scripting, etc.) |
| Intrusion Attempts | Login attempts | Multiple login attempts (Guessing / cracking of passwords, brute force). |
| Intrusion Attempts | New attack signature | An attack using an unknown exploit. |
| Intrusions | Privileged Account Compromise | Compromise of a system where the attacker gained administrative privileges. |
| Intrusions | Unprivileged Account Compromise | Compromise of a system using an unprivileged (user/service) account. |
| Intrusions | Application Compromise | Compromise of an application by exploiting (un)known software vulnerabilities, e.g. SQL injection. |
| Intrusions | Burglary | Physical intrusion, e.g. into corporate building or data center. |
| Availability | DoS | Denial of Service attack, e.g. sending specially crafted requests to a web application which causes the application to crash or slow down. |
| Availability | DDoS | Distributed Denial of Service attack, e.g. SYN-Flood or UDP-based reflection/amplification attacks. |
| Availability | Sabotage | Physical sabotage, e.g cutting wires or malicious arson. |
| Availability | Outage | Outage caused e.g. by air condition failure or natural disaster. |
| Information Content Security | Unauthorised access to information | Unauthorized access to information, e.g. by abusing stolen login credentials for a system or application, intercepting traffic or gaining access to physical documents. |
| Information Content Security | Unauthorised modification of information | Unauthorised modification of information, e.g. by an attacker abusing stolen login credentials for a system or application or a ransomware encrypting data. |
| Information Content Security | Data Loss | Loss of data, e.g. caused by harddisk failure or physical theft. |
| Fraud | Unauthorized use of resources | Using resources for unauthorized purposes including profit-making ventures, e.g. the use of e-mail to participate in illegal profit chain letters or pyramid schemes. |
| Fraud | Copyright | Offering or Installing copies of unlicensed commercial software or other copyright protected materials (Warez). |
| Fraud | Masquerade | Type of attack in which one entity illegitimately impersonates the identity of another in order to benefit from it. |
| Fraud | Phishing | Masquerading as another entity in order to persuade the user to reveal private credentials. |
| Vulnerable | Weak crypto | Publicly accessible services offering weak crypto, e.g. web servers susceptible to POODLE/FREAK attacks. |
| Vulnerable | DDoS amplifier | Publicly accessible services that can be abused for conducting DDoS reflection/amplification attacks, e.g. DNS open-resolvers or NTP servers with monlist enabled. |
| Vulnerable | Potentially unwanted accessible services | Potentially unwanted publicly accessible services, e.g. Telnet, RDP or VNC. |
| Vulnerable | Information disclosure | Publicly accessible services potentially disclosing sensitive information, e.g. SNMP or Redis. |
| Vulnerable | Vulnerable system | A system which is vulnerable to certain attacks. Example: misconfigured client proxy settings (example: WPAD), outdated operating system version, etc. |
| Other | Other | All incidents which don't fit in one of the given categories should be put into this class. |
| Test | Test | Meant for testing. |
