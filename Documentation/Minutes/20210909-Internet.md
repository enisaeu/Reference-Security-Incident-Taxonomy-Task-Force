## discussion points 
- CERT.at: can translations of RSIT be part of the repository or should they be external only?
    - INCIBE: Put in repository
    - CESNET: Put into contrib to make clear the translation is not the official translation and the WG is not responsible to maintain it
    - german translation is to be reviewed by others of course
- use of plurals (https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/issues/114)
    - Some names are in plural, others are in singular
    - Proposal is to use singular only
    - Agreed
    - INCIBE create PR 116
    - Machine-readable value "intrusion-attempts" is affected as well, only change those in the next major version
        - CERT.at to create a "reminder issue" to not forget this
- "dropzone"
    - To be discussed if dropzone should be part of RSIT taxonomy "Information Content Security"
    - CESNET: Is actionable
    - CSIRT-UMINHO: not create a new type, root cause can be classified under another type
    - CESNET: usually you don't know the cause, especially in automation
    - different aspects of drop zones, can be part of other classifications (malware-configuration, data-leak, unauthorised-information-access, other)
    - in initial mapping of taxonomies, CERT.pt kept this type
    - FIXME conclusion
- Does the RSIT define a "security incident"? https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/issues/87
    - Scope of "security incident" is not clear
    - CESNET: Scope of RSIT was discussed and made clear several times already
    - just reference an existing definition
    - Gabriel: NIST https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/incident
    - INCIBE: ISO standard
    - ENISA: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/glossary
    - Add references as comments on #87 for review on next meeting

## Review of pending pull requests
- INCIBE: Add a Makefile for generated files
    - https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/pull/115
    - merged
- CERT.at: fix version tag to 1003 in machinev1
    - https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/pull/109
    - merged
- CERT.at: fix filename of 2019-09-16 meeting in Paphos
    - https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/pull/110
    - merged
- 
- INCIBE: Change "Information Content Security" to "Information Security": https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/pull/113
    - Is a major change, would require a major version change (put it to the backlog for next bigger changes?)
    - CESNET, CERT.at, Gabriel: "Information Security" has a much broader meaning than "Information Content Security"
    - Taxonomy is about Data / Content, maybe rename it to "Data Security"
    - Why is `Content` in italics in the eCSIRT II?
- PRs from TERNA: Still open, TERNA is not present here
- TERNA: "TERNA PR2 (Update machinev1)" https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/pull/106
    - closed, already discussed at the previous meetings
- TERNA: "TERNA PR4 & PR5 (Update machinev1)" https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/pull/96
    - Introduces a new taxonomy "accidental event", moves "misconfiguration" there
    - CESNET: Doesn't say anything about the event, just that anything happened. An accident may be a cause for other issues which can be categorized.
    - wait for answer from TERNA
- https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/pull/105
    - "bomb threats"
- INCIBE: Change plurals into singular in the human names https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/pull/116
    - next time
    - Description "login attempts" of brute-force should not be changes to singular, as a brute-force-event contains multiple login attempts
- 

# Actions for next meeting:

- RSIT members to review still open pull requests and provide input
 
Closure of the meeting.
