# Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force Use cases
To give a better understanding of how a reference taxonomy can be of benefit for the community, we list here a series of high level use cases. 

# Incident handling 
The taxonomy is used within the IR tool used by the team, for information sharing with other teams or to pivot mapping with another taxonomy used by another team/external entity.

# Incident reporting
The taxonomy is used for post mortem incident reporting to the top management or to an external entity and to pivot mapping with another taxonomy used by another team/ external entity.

# Media outreach
The taxonomy is used pivot mapping with another taxonomy used by another team/external entity for media outreach. This allows a better understanding of the findings and comparison with internal results to the press and relevant audience.

# Policy discussion
The taxonomy is used for pivot mapping with another taxonomy used by another team/external entity to assist policy discussions with policy makers. This allows having a common ground from where to start the decision-making process. Moreover, this is also beneficial for mapping to legal terminology. 

# Cross border incidents
The taxonomy is used for pivot mapping with another taxonomy used by another team external entity when the team is involved in a cross border/CERT sharing of incidents

# Pivot mapping with existing initiatives
The taxonomy is used for pivot mapping with another taxonomy used by another team external entity for another initiative.

# Statistics
## Performance and internal KPIs
The taxonomy is associated with internal performance indicators and KPIs destined for the upper management. This allows gathering historical data and provides a quick overview on the load and capacity of the team.   

## Comparison with other entities
The taxonomy is used to compare data from other entities, countries and sectors in order to assess particular campaign impact and to pivot mapping with another taxonomy used by another team/external entity.
  
## Trends
The taxonomy is used to analyse data over time in order to identify any consistent results or trends.

## Global / annual overview
The taxonomy is used to aggregate data from different teams and in order to identify historical, global and annual results or trends.
  
## Explanation of external report
The taxonomy is used to pivot mapping with another taxonomy used by another team/external entity for a specific external report. This allows a better understanding of the findings and comparison with internal results to the upper management.

# Limitations
The taxonomy is not a silver bullet and does not solve all the problems but allows having a common ground from where to start discuss and exchange data. There will be always challenges in incident data exchange because no taxonomy fits all needs or should fit all needs but at least this allows a common understanding and comparison.

Caveats
The taxonomy is valid for the sole use of reference and pivot mapping. Unless rectified by a relevant entity, it does not have any legal validity.
